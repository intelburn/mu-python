Bonus A) The weather has on average gotten a little bit more extreme in more recent years. I am defining extreme using two different criteria, the difference between min and max temperature with a larger amount of precipitation. The delta between the min and max averaged across each year. The deltas have increased, but the precipitation across the year has mostly just fluctuated across years.
